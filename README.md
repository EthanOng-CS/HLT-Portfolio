# HLT-Portfolio
This is the all of the work I've done in CS 4395 Human Langauge Technologies

## Overview of HLT
You can see the Overview of HLT [PDF Document](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Overview_of_NLP.pdf)

## Assignment 1 - Texet Processing with Python

### Overview
Program - [Python File](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%201/Homework1_elo180000.py)
<br />
CSV File = [CSV File](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%201/data/data.csv)
  
### Description of Program
The program takes in the CSV file and processes the data and outputs it in a specific way using pickle. 

### How to Run
1. To run the program open pycharm and open the "Homework1_elo180000.py" <br />
2. In the top right corner click on the name with the drop down arrow and click on "Edit Configuration..." <br />
3. Type in "data/data.csv" in the "Parametes:" <br />
4. click on "Apply" and then "ok"<br />
5. Click on the gree triangle in the top right to run the program 

### Strength/Weaknesses of Python for Text Processing
In my opinion python makes text processing pretty easy, understandable and clean. One weakness is that python text processing is that it is not aslways done    coreect and it can't read everything that that be fixed automatically.

### What I learn
Throughout the time I work on this assignment I learn how to manipulate strings and program regular expressions, for my first time using python. I also learn how to use pickle in python.
