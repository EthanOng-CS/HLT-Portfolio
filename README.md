### Overview

### Description of Program
The program takes in the CSV file and processes the data and outputs it in a specific way using pickle. 
### How to Run

### Strength/Weaknesses of Python for Text Processing
In my opinion python makes text processing pretty easy, understandable and clean. One weakness is that python text processing is that it is not aslways done coreect and it can't read everything that that be fixed automatically.

### What I learn
Throughout the time I work on this assignment I learn how to manipulate strings and program regular expressions, for my first time using python. I also learn how to use pickle in python.
