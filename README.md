# HLT-Portfolio
This is the all of the work I've done in CS 4395 Human Langauge Technologies

## Overview of HLT
You can see the Overview of HLT [PDF Document](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Overview_of_NLP.pdf)

## Assignment 1 - Text Processing with Python

### Overview
[Python File](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%201/Homework1_elo180000.py)
<br />
[CSV File](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%201/data/data.csv)
  
### Description of Program
The program takes in the CSV file and processes the data and outputs it in a specific way using pickle. 

### How to Run
1. To run the program open pycharm and open the "Homework1_elo180000.py" <br />
2. In the top right corner click on the name with the drop down arrow and click on "Edit Configuration..." <br />
3. Type in "data/data.csv" in the "Parametes:" <br />
4. click on "Apply" and then "ok"<br />
5. Click on the gree triangle in the top right to run the program 

### Strength/Weaknesses of Python for Text Processing
In my opinion python makes text processing pretty easy, understandable and clean. One weakness is that python text processing is that it is not aslways done    coreect and it can't read everything that that be fixed automatically.

### What I learn
Throughout the time I work on this assignment I learn how to manipulate strings and program regular expressions, for my first time using python. I also learn how to use pickle in python.

## Assignment 2 - Word Guessing Game
[Python File](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%202/homework2_elo180000.py)
<br />
[Data File](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%202/anat19.txt)

This is a word guessing game where it take the 50 most common nouns from the text file. The user gets to start with 5 points and tries to guess the word. The game adds 1 point if the user guess correctly and minus 1 point it the user guess incorrectly. If the user score goes below 0 meaning the score is in the negative the game ends.

## Assignment 3 - WordNet
[Python File (IPYNB)](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%203/homework3_elo180000.ipynb)
<br />
[Python File](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%203/homework3_elo180000.pdf)

This is a Google Collab where I demonstrate WordNet and SentiWordNet by outputting simple functions 

## Assignment 4 - N-Grams Language Model
[Python File - Program 1](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%204/homework4_Program1_elo180000.py)
<br />
[Python File - Program 2](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%204/homework4_Program2_elo180000.py)
<br />
[Data File](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/tree/main/Assignment%204/data)

This Program is done by myself. I used 3 different langauge (English, French, and Itlaian) to make a program that can calculate the probability of sentences given a corpus. There are 2 program within this assignment:
<br />
Program 1 - This breaks down the data files of each language and generates numbers for unigrams and bigrams.
<br />
Program 2 - Takes the unigrams and bigrams from the program 1 and gets the probability of a sentence.

### How To Run:
1. To run the program open pycharm and open both python files<br />
2. In the top right corner click on the name with the drop down arrow and click on "Edit Configuration..." <br />
3. Type in "data/LangId.train.English, data/LangId.train.French, data/LangId.train.Italian" <br />
4. click on "Apply" and then "ok"<br />
5. Click on the gree triangle in the top right to run program 1.<br />
6. After running program 1 and it is finish, run program 2.<br />

## Assignment 5 - Web Crawler 
[Python File](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%205/Homework5_elo180000.py)

I build a corpus by creating a scraper and web crawler to create a knowledge base.

## Assignment 6 - Parsing Sentences
[PDF File](https://github.com/EthanOng-CS/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%206/homework6_elo180000.pdf)

I learn how to use 3 different kinds of parsing technique: Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency, Semantic Role Label (SRL)

## Assignment 7 - Chatbot (WIP)

## Assignment 8 - ACL Paper Summary

I did a paper summary about [Beyond Goldfish Memoryâˆ—: Long-Term Open-Domain Conversation](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.356.pdf)
